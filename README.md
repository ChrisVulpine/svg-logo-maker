## Description
This is a simple SVG logo generator that runs in the CLI and allows the user to create a custom logo based on answers to prompts in the CLI. The user will be prompted to choose: 3 characters, the color of those characters, a shape from a list of three shapes, and a color for that shape. Once the questions are answered, the logo will be generated.
